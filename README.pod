=item B<-u> I<uid>

=item B<-p> I<path>

mount point as arguments.

=back

=head1 BLACKLISTING

ldm doesn't offer any blacklisting by itself but it honors the options found in the fstab so it will ignore any device with flag I<noauto>.

=head1 INSTALL

The included systemd service expects a config file at /etc/ldm.conf which contains your user uid and gid. Don't be scared, it's just a matter of writing down 2 lines using your favourite editor.
