2011 (C) The Lemon Man

A lightweight daemon that mounts usb drives, cds, dvds or floppys
automagically. Made for people that have no desktop-manager with
all the bells and whistles but still want to enjoy automount.
It does mount every device in /media and names them by either
(in order) volume label, volume uuid or device serial or using the
fstab rule for that device, if defined.
Everything in ~14Kb of C code with libudev as only dependency.
